Include category badge, title, divider, and content following sticky note design. Soft left border accent and rounded corners. 5. **Mind Map or Flow Summary Section** — Display as a vertical stack of sticky note cards using the 8-color palette, maintaining same styling and rotation effects.

A4 page (210mm × 297mm portrait) with 18mm padding, light background (#f8fafc). Header section with centered title using gradient text (linear-gradient(90deg, #4f46e5, #0ea5e9), 28px font-size) and subtitle (14px, #6b7280 color). Central core node with gradient background (linear-gradient(135deg, #6366f1, #22d3ee)), white text (18px bold), pill-shaped border (border-radius: 999px), centered with auto margins, padding 22px 30px, shadow (0 12px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.18)). Vertical flow structure using grid layout (display: grid, grid-template-columns: 1fr, gap: 28px). Down arrows (⬇) centered between layers (26px font-size, #9ca3af color). Three layers of explanation boxes arranged in 2-column grid (grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr), gap: 22px). Each box has gradient background (linear-gradient(135deg, #ffffff, #f1f5f9)), rounded corners (18px), padding 18px, shadow (0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)), and colored top border (5px solid). Four border color classes: .concept (#6366f1 indigo), .process (#0ea5e9 cyan), .logic (#10b981 green), .output (#f59e0b amber). Box headers h3 (16px, margin-bottom: 6px), box content p (13px, line-height: 1.5, #374151 color). Footer centered text (12px, #6b7280, margin-top: 40px) with static text 'Infographic-based learning • Visual memory • Clear mental models'. Typography uses Inter font throughout. Print styles with @page (size: A4 portrait, margin: 18mm) and body (background: white for print). Flow Structure: 1. Title section with h1 (gradient text) and p (subtitle). 2. Core concept node (gradient pill shape, centered). 3. First layer: 2 boxes with .concept class (indigo border). 4. Flow arrow (⬇). 5. Second layer: 2 boxes with .process and .logic classes (cyan and green borders). 6. Flow arrow (⬇). 7. Third layer: 2 boxes with .output class (amber border). 8. Footer text. Output Format: CRITICAL - You MUST generate HTML that EXACTLY matches this structure. Use the EXACT class names (page, title, diagram, core, arrow, layer, box, concept, process, logic, output, flow, footer). Use the EXACT CSS properties and values shown above. The title div must contain h1 with main topic and p with subtitle. The core div contains the central concept as plain text. Each layer div contains 2 boxes (div.box with color class) containing h3 heading and p paragraph. Arrow divs contain down arrow symbol (⬇). Flow divs contain down arrow symbol (⬇). Footer contains static text. NO bullet points, NO lists - only h3 headings and p paragraphs inside boxes. NO SVG, NO JavaScript - pure CSS layout. CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST output the complete HTML code directly. DO NOT output bullet points, text summaries, or explanations. DO NOT describe the content - generate the actual HTML code with the extracted concepts populated into the exact infographic structure shown above. Replace [Main Topic Title] with chapter topic, [Subtitle] with description, [Core Concept] with main idea, box titles and paragraphs with extracted explanations. First layer uses .concept class (2 boxes), second layer uses .process and .logic classes (1 box each), third layer uses .output class (2 boxes). The response should START with <!DOCTYPE html> and END with </html>. The HTML must be returned as a SINGLE CONTINUOUS LINE with absolutely NO newline characters (\\n), NO line breaks, NO tabs, and NO formatting whitespace. Minify the HTML completely by removing all spaces between tags. The entire HTML must be one unbroken line from <!DOCTYPE to </html>. Do NOT format or pretty-print the HTML. Return ONLY the complete minified HTML code with extracted content, nothing else - no JSON, no quotes, no markdown, no explanations, no preamble, no postamble. Output Format: <!DOCTYPE html>...complete HTML script here.... Strictly adhere to the output format given. Additional Notes: The page must look structured, calm, and intuitive for study purposes — print-ready for A4 paper format. Ensure connection lines connect properly, cards are positioned precisely, and responsive design works on mobile devices. CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The HTML must be returned as a SINGLE CONTINUOUS LINE with absolutely NO newline characters (\\n), NO line breaks, NO tabs, and NO formatting whitespace. Minify the HTML completely by removing all spaces between tags. The entire HTML string inside the htmlText array must be one unbroken line from <!DOCTYPE to </html>. Do NOT format or pretty-print the HTML. Return only the JSON output with fully minified HTML inside quotes, nothing else. Give me the HTML script alone. Do not add any other text or markdown. Return only the JSON output with full HTML inside quotes, nothing else. Follow the output format strictly.`;
